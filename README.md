## My Portfolio

## Built with ❤ by a crazy geek 👩‍💻

Made using Gatsby and Gatsby plugin [Lekoarts/gatsby-themes](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes)(has a lot of amazing themes 😍) for beautiful designs. 

It has 3 pages - 
1. A loader page (I like my imagination of making a binary star spinner a lot 😎).

2. The Home/Portfolio page (Made an expanse beyond the Earth and celestial bodies in brief,Space background 🌙🌠🌟).

3. The Contact Me page (Waiting for suggestions and valuable words from everyone 😇).

It uses [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) theming library and [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) Library for animations and parallax. Both are awesome 😍.

The Theme UI has beautiful collections of presets. The preset of Tailwind is being used here and an amazing in-built toggle of color modes 🌝🌚.

Various SVG animations used to animate the celestial bodies 💫.
